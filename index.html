                    Any time you take physical damage, you can opt to instead say your shield absorbed the force of the blow. The shield is shattered and must be discarded, but you donâ€™t take any damage from that hit.

                <div class="mechanic">
                    Whenever you need that boost to make a d20 roll, you can spend one hit die and add it to (or subtract it from) the result. Hell, spend more than one HD if you really want to make this save (but then only the highest result counts). Fighty classes can spend their hit dice to add to damage.

                    The Big Yellow D30 Rule
                </div>

                <div class="mechanic">
                    Once per session each player may opt to roll the big yellow d30 in lieu of whatever dice or die the situation calls for. The choice to roll the big yellow d30 must be made before any roll. The d30 cannot be rolled for generating character statistics or hit points.
